# Blue-OCI Code of Conflict

The development effort of Blue-OCI is a very personal process compared to "traditional" ways of developing software. Your recommendations and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and criticism. Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success of Blue-OCI. 

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable. If so, please contact us at blue-oci@tommytran.io or the individual members, and they will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.

As a maintainer or collaborator of Blue-OCI, please strive to keep things civil and focused on the technical issues involved. We are all humans, and frustration can be high on both sides of the process. Try to keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and Ted: "Be excellent to each other."
