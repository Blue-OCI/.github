Blue OCI is a collection of minimal OCI containers. All of them are rebuilt daily, include hardened_malloc, and scanned for vulnerabilities.

We strive for maximum compatibility with upstream. Alpine is used as a base image whenever possible.

Our number one priority is vulnerability patching. We will ship the latest version of packages as soon as possible. We will not pin package versions or hashes that we cannot maintain in a reasonable manner.
