Blue OCI is a collection of OCI containers aiming to improve security over upstream builds. Our containers comes with hardened_malloc daily and are rebuilt and scanned daily.

We strive for maximum compatibility with upstream. Alpine and unprivileged users are used whenever possible.

Our number one priority is vulnerability patching. We will ship the latest version of packages as soon as possible. We will not pin package versions or hashes that we cannot maintain in a reasonable manner.
